# Edited greetings where they were no longer appropriate for SI ethics

01_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAT_SPI:0 "Can you tell us more about that primitive philosophy you're so fond of in the [Root.GetName]? We could use a good laugh!"
02_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAT_SPI:0 "How any rational, thinking being could embrace spiritualism is beyond us. Why is it that you cling to such limiting beliefs?"
03_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAT_SPI:0 "We have seen through your charade. The economic restrictions your government has imposed are nothing more than a devious attempt to limit the development of your people."
04_INSULT_PROPOSE_MAT_SPI:0 "Everyone else is laughing at your absurd environmentalism. Are you really so blind in the [Root.GetName] that you can't see this?"

01_INSULT_PROPOSE_SPI_MAT:0 "What a dull and soulless place your materialistic nation must be. Tell me, have you invented a sense of humor yet? No? A pity."
02_INSULT_PROPOSE_SPI_MAT:0 "For a nation that has embraced materialism, the [Root.GetName] is remarkably primitive. Is it due to bad luck or are you just stupid?"
03_INSULT_PROPOSE_SPI_MAT:0 "The [Root.GetName] is a nation designed for automatons, not breathing organics. Are you even capable of feeling emotion?"
04_INSULT_PROPOSE_SPI_MAT:0 "The [Root.GetName] is a failed experiment. Its only worth is as a lesson to the rest of the galaxy on the dangers of embracing the cold and lifeless philosophy of materialism."

04_INSULT_PROPOSE_COL_IND:0 "Your people are proof that not all sapient being are created equal. Egalitarianism... ha! The [Root.GetName] will not survive the year."

09_HOSTILE_GREETING:1 "[From.GetSpeciesNameInsult], your uncouth [From.GetRandomSpeciesSound] is heard by the [Root.GetName]. What do you want?"
10_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "Your materialist philosophies have transformed your species into soulless machines, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
12_HOSTILE_GREETING:0 "Ah, the [From.GetSpeciesName] zealots. If you have come to convert the [Root.GetName] to your despicable philosophy, I shall terminate communications."


10_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Know that you are in our prayers, friends, despite your misguided philosophies of materialism."
11_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Greetings to you, [From.GetSpeciesName] friends. How goes your research?"
12_FRIENDLY_GREETING:0 "Some would call your people zealots, but we know better. Was there something you wanted to discuss, friend?"

08_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "You should reconsider your conciliatory ways, [From.GetSpeciesName]. Someone is bound to take advantage of them."
09_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "May you find peace, [From.GetSpeciesName]. What can we do for you?"
10_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "The materialistic path you are on concerns us, [From.GetSpeciesName]. You must not forget your the intrinsic value of life."
12_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "Your dogma has been the source of much poverty, [From.GetSpeciesName]. We wish you would reconsider your irrational spiritualism."
14_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "We are deeply concerned about the inequality between your citizens, [From.GetSpeciesName]."
16_NEUTRAL_GREETING:0 "We urge you to keep your lower classes in check, [From.GetSpeciesName]. They are a danger to themselves if left to their own devices."
